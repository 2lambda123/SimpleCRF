# CRF_wrap
Matlab and python wrap of conditional random field (CRF) and dense CRF, both 2D and 3D are supported, according to the following papers:

[1] Yuri Boykov and Vladimir Kolmogorov, "An experimental comparison of min-cut/max-flow algorithms for energy minimization in vision", in IEEE TPAMI, 2004.

Pushmeet Kohli and Philip H.S. Torr. "Efficiently solving dynamic markov random fields using graph cuts", ICCV, 2005
